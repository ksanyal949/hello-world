Hello Humans! 
K.San here, I am currently working on HTML and CSS and afterwards will focus on JavaScript

After a solid foundation in all 3 programming languaged I will focus on building my portfolio and accumulating relative projects that will help showcase a strong understanding of Front End Development

At that point I will have to make a decision whether to search for a job in FE Dev. or begin exploring Back End languages such as Python or Rails 

We'll see how things go!
